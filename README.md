The Jupyter Notebooks in this repository were used to generate the T-cell Fractions using the whole-genome sequences from the All of Us study. The WDL in this repository was used to generate the T-cell Fractions using the whole-genome sequences from the TOPMed cohorts. These are the foundational code pieces necessary to perform the analyses in Genetic determinants and phenotypic consequences of blood T-cell proportions in 207,000 diverse individuals.
